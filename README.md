  With NeighborGoods, you can keep track of the food pantries you have visited and write private notes and public reviews. Did that food pantry you visit yesterday have fresh produce? Write a note to yourself so you remember for next time! 
  
  Our mission is to provide access to healthy and nutritious food for our neighbors, and remove the stigma behind receiving food assistance. Utilizing this application will bring awareness to food pantry services within the Chicagoland area and minimize stigmas sorrounding it.

  [Pure.css](https://purecss.io/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/), and the [Waze](https://expressjs.com/) API were used to create this application.

 The deployed site can be found [here](https://bread-winners-neighborgoods.herokuapp.com/).

  ## Future:
  When researching APIs for this project, we discovered that a United States food pantry database does not exist. We had to seed the database ourselves with Chicago food pantries. In the next version of the application, we want to scrape the Feeding America site to create a more robust database.
  
  In a future development, NeighborGoods:
  
  * Will have a section where users can post items they are giving away to people in need 
  * Will have more in-depth information regarding limits to how many times a person can visit the pantry per week
  * Will have a calendar feature to track where and how many times a user has visited a pantry
